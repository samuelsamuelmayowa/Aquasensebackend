How much fish you produced (yield)

How many survived or died (survival & mortality rates)

How fast they grew (growth rate)

How efficient feeding was (FCR – Feed Conversion Ratio)

How much it cost to produce fish

How much money you made (profit, ROI, etc.)



what am thinking to do 

Collect raw data (like pond size, number of fish, feed used, cost, harvest weight, etc.).

Do the math using the formulas in that document.

Save and return those calculated results (KPIs) through your API.



After collecting all this the farmers see this below 

Your survival rate is 92%”

“Your profit this cycle was ₦250,000”

“Your feed efficiency is 1.3”




You’re building a mobile aquaculture management app for farmers, and:

Each farmer (user) can record data offline on their phone — like stocking, feeding, labour, maintenance, income, etc.

Each of those data points (FeedModel, IncomeModel, etc.) is stored locally with a isSynced flag (to mark whether it’s been uploaded to the backend).

When the farmer gets back online, all unsynced data is sent to your backend (MySQL).

You want to make sure this process is safe, efficient, and handles concurrency, so data doesn’t get duplicated or lost.

You’re also planning to compute production performance metrics and profitability KPIs (like yield, survival rate, FCR, ROI, etc.) once the data is synced.
